Methodology is something based on particular principles and the methods, it is a technique that data professionals use to understand a datasets before starting to model it.

## Conclusion:
- Indian National Congress Ruled for 60 years following the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi - If we follow this pattern, then we can say that for upcoming year BJP will dominate Indian Politics under the leadership of Mr. Narendra Modi
- Also, Women's contribution in Indian Politics is still less (20%) even after 75 years of Independence, But considering the positive espect we can see that recent President Mrs Droupadi Murmu is the yougest president born after Independence so far in the Indian Histroy and also the first President belonging to Tribal community. Hence we can say that status of women representation is increasing in coming years
